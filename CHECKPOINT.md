**GitHub Repository:** <https://github.com/AjWestfield/SuperChatAI>  
**Tag:** working-version-1.0

This document serves as a comprehensive snapshot of the SuperChatAI project's current state, outlining implemented features, configuration, and development progress.

## Project Overview

SuperChatAI is an advanced AI chatbot application built with Next.js and the AI SDK. It provides an intuitive chat interface with powerful AI capabilities, document management, and a rich suite of interactive features.

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.3.0-canary.31 (using App Router architecture)
- **AI Integration:** AI SDK with xAI's Grok models
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication:** Auth.js (formerly NextAuth)
- **Containerization:** Docker for local development

## Implemented Features

### Authentication & User Management

- User registration and login functionality
- Guest authentication support
- Secure authentication using Auth.js
- User session management

### Chat Interface

- Real-time streaming chat with AI responses
- Message history with persistence
- Support for multimodal content (text, images, files)
- Reasoning capabilities with AI models
- Message upvoting/downvoting

### Document Management

- Document creation and editing
- Support for multiple document types:
  - Text documents
  - Code snippets
  - Spreadsheets
  - Images
- Suggestions system for document improvements

### AI Features

- Integration with xAI's Grok models:
  - grok-2-vision-1212 for multimodal inputs
  - grok-3-mini-beta for reasoning
  - grok-2-1212 for general text and artifacts
- Model selection capability
- Custom system prompts

### Developer Experience

- Comprehensive component library
- Type-safe API routes and database queries
- ESLint and Biome for code quality
- Docker Compose for local database setup

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database includes tables for:

- Users
- Chats
- Messages (with v2 and legacy support)
- Documents
- Suggestions
- Streams
- Votes (with v2 and legacy support)

## Environment Configuration

The project requires the following environment variables:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: Random secret for Auth.js
- `XAI_API_KEY`: API key for xAI services
- `POSTGRES_URL`: Database connection string
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`: Token for Vercel Blob storage

## Development Setup Progress

1. ✅ Project initialization and dependency installation
2. ✅ Docker setup for local PostgreSQL
3. ✅ Database schema creation
4. ✅ AI provider configuration with xAI
5. ✅ Authentication system setup

## Current Limitations and Future Improvements

- Placeholder storage token for Vercel Blob
- Local-only deployment (not yet deployed to production)
- No Redis integration yet for resumable streams
- Default UI theme without custom branding

## Run Instructions

1. Start the PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Access the application at <http://localhost:3000>
